yomitori
========

Tools to generate custom student editions of Japanese texts.
Default output is Kindle-sized PDF files, but HTML, Word, and
LibreOffice are also supported. This is very much a work in
progress, and no matter how messy it looks, trust me that it's
far better than the version I've been reading novels with for
the past two years.

Requirements
------------

* Perl 5.10.1+ with DBI, DBD::SQLite, Text::MeCab, XML::Twig, Archive::Zip
* [JMdict and JMnedict](http://www.edrdg.org/)
* [MeCab](https://code.google.com/p/mecab/)
* [Unidic](http://en.sourceforge.jp/projects/unidic/)
* [TeXLive 2013](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* [dviasm.py](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/dviware/dviasm)
  (distributed with TeXLive)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com/),
  and a [UI theme](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/), if you don't
  want to just use Google-hosted versions.

Tools
-----

* ytmakedict: convert JMdict and JMnedict into a simple SQLite database
* ytgloss: add readings and English definitions to a UTF8-encoded text file
* ytknown: strip out definitions and readings for words the user knows
* ytruby: convert the embedded readings into proper furigana by stripping
  out leading, trailing, and interior kana
* yt2latex: format a document for processing with upLaTeX
* yt2odt: convert to LibreOffice/OpenOffice, with basic ruby support
* yt2word: convert to Word HTML, with vertical text and basic ruby support
* yt2html: convert to HTML with ruby tags and jQueryUI-based tooltips
* dvicleanruby: use dviasm.py to strip furigana that appear more than
  once per page.
* ytvocab: extract a vocabulary list from a document, optionally
  incorporating page-number information from the upLaTeX .aux file.
  Normal text output can be pasted into Word/LibreOffice and
  converted to a table.
* ytdegloss: strip all embedded readings and glosses from a file;
  useful for comparing versions of a document.
* Yomitori.pm: utility functions

Basic Usage
-----------

	kanji-config-updmap auto
	ytmakedict
    ytgloss -f fixparse.txt -g fixgloss.txt foo.txt |
        ytknown -k known.txt -r rubyonly.txt > foo.yt
    ytruby foo.yt | yt2latex > foo.tex
    uplatex foo.tex
    dvicleanruby foo.dvi
    dvipdfmx foo.dvi

    ytvocab -t foo.aux -l foo.yt > foo-vocab.tex
	uplatex foo-vocab.tex
	dvipdfmx foo-vocab.dvi

    ytruby foo.yt | yt2odt -o foo.odt
    ytruby foo.yt | yt2word > foo.doc
	yt2html foo.yt > foo.html

TODO
----

* document the config file and known/rubyonly/fix* files, with samples
* yt2html: use decent CSS styling
* add ab2yt to convert Aozora Bunko markup (clean up old code)
* add additional paper sizes to yt2latex
* clean up ytmakedict code and output
* explain the tricky bits
* make ytgloss/ytknown preserve ruby for known word with variant kanji.
  Ex: Unidic reports 提げる as 下げる; JMdict glosses them differently,
  but since I lookup by dictform first, I merge them together; ditto for
  殺る as やる, 訊く as 聞く, etc. 高飛び gets the wrong gloss because
  of this, because Unidic normalizes to 高跳び.
* ytgloss bug: should catch もしかすると as expression
* Unidic glitch: can't match いつの間にか because Unidic returns あいだ
  as the reading for 間; this is probably like getting た for 他 in
  too many contexts, sigh.
* Unidic glitch: 今日一日, returns ついたち instead of いちにち
* small tool to more easily override Unidic glitches; writing Perl
  one-liners to extract and modify the existing records gets old fast.
