お園	おその	Osono

#this one doesn't get matched because of some of the false-positive
#heuristics in ytgloss
#
一伍一什	いちごいちじゅう	[n] full particulars; the whole story; from beginning to end

#Missed because Unidic weights 叱る higher than 然る, which is
#how JMdict glosses it.
#
しかるに	しかるに	[adv,conj] however; still; but

#I don't know why ipadic and unidic both prefer idaku to daku
#
抱く	だく	to embrace; to hold in the arms

#non-standard glossing, from original AB furigana
拙僧	わたし	I, as a mere priest; this humble servant of Buddha

#Handling oddball verbs:
#  The original Aozora Bunko text had:
#    ...嫁《かたづ》けられ、
#  an evocative-but-nonstandard gloss of 片付ける.
#  Fixing this properly requires generating a MeCab dictionary entry
#  that has the right conjugation and context, which requires pulling
#  the normal verb out of the Unidic source file lex.csv and editing
#  all the matching lines. These go into a userdict file whose name
#  ends in .csv, which ytgloss will just pass through to mecab:
#    grep 片付ける lex.csv | sed -ne '/^片付/ s/片付/嫁/gp' >> userdict.csv
#
#  Now you can add a custom gloss for it, so that the correct meaning
#  shows up in the vocab list.
#TODO: uncomment this line once I separate custom parsing
#from custom glossing
#嫁ける	かたづける	to marry off (e.g. a daughter)
