#this one is obnoxious enough that it needs to be global. Name-達
#gets parsed as Name-tooru; othernoun-達 is fine. We need to copy
#the tooru line from the Unidic source and replace with a tachi
#line that has the same context:
#    perl -CADS -ne 'use utf8;if (/^達,/ and s/ト.ル/タチ/g) {
#        @a=split(/,/);$a[3]-=5000;print join(",",@a);
#    }' lex.csv >> userdict.csv
